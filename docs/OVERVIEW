pommo/ 
		"Base Directory"
		$pommo->_baseURL will point to this directory relative to its location on the webserver's URL
		$pommo->_baseDir will point to this directory relative to its location on the server filesystem
			 

pommo/config.php
		The configuration file. Sets up database, locale, debugging, and forced hostname/port.
			
			
pommo/bootstrap.php
		This file is required to access poMMo. It sets up the "$pommo" global and loads the API
		functions. All PHP scripts require this file @ their header.
			
			
pommo/admin/
		"Administrative Directory" - web enabled
		This directory contains all the pages available to the poMMo administrator. Since
		poMMo is built around a MVC framework, the "view" (or page content) for each page
		is found in the pommo/themes/ directory. The themes structure correlates exactly
		to that of pommo/user or pommo/admin, so that;
		
		"pommo/admin/mailings/admin_mailings.php" will call;
		"pommo/themes/default/admin/mailings/admin_mailings.tpl" for its view if the "default"
		 theme is selected.

		Files in "AJAX" directories are called via an ajax request & typically return JSON. They
		are (usually) not associated with a view.
		
		
pommo/cache/
